Project Proposal :
Market for users to be able to sell games or consoles they have all uploaded on their account or buy from other users. Have a dashboard area that displays games or consoles available based on the search. Requests for buying games are sent to users inbox who then approves the item to go through which sends a confirmation to the other users inbox whether the requests are approved or not. 




Brainstorm things Needed for Web App:

User stores games and consoles for sale
Login page for user
Dashboard page for things available on the game market
Messaging page for inbox and sent mail
Confirmation page for display for buying an item, send the confirmation page to inbox.
